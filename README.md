Arduino sketch for my cookie clicker clicker

The cookie clicker clicker uses a stepper motor to tap the screen to click the cookie. The stepper motor is driven by a [Polulu](https://www.pololu.com/product/1182) compatible driver module connected to the [CNCshield](http://blog.protoneer.co.nz/arduino-cnc-shield/).
